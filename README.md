A Calcomp space pen pen-holder.

Info on how to create a pen holder for the Calcomp 565 plotter to use a Fisher Space pen.

```
Some quick answers for now. A normal space pen is longer than the calcomp
pens by about .5 inches if I remember correctly. The other dimentions seemed
similar. I was making a calcomp pressured pen holder since the one I have 
is on loan. I can take pictures/measurements later. The plunger is different
due to the larger diameter. I don't remember if it just doesn't have the
insert. The part with the coil is the same. If you know someone with a lathe
making a top and plunger to fit eitehr isn't that bad.```
